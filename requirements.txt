# Runtime Dependencies
# ====================
# The Hotspot KBM Server is designed to be "Zero-Dependency".
# It uses Python's standard library (fcntl, os, struct, socket) to communicate
# directly with the Linux kernel (uinput) and network.
#
# No external packages like `python-uinput` or `evdev` are required to run the server.

# Development & Testing
# =====================
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-mock>=3.10.0
